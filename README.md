## ABSTRACT
Finding a little privacy to answer Mother Nature's call isn't always so easy when you're out exploring Mother Nature. Especially when you're on a bike. More especially when you're in one of Utah's five National Parks- those places get busy!!! The struggle can become very real and when you have to leave your bike outside amidst among all the people, that can get a bit nerve-wracking. Enter: Piddles & Peddles, an application that lets cyclists know where the restrooms are in Utah's national parks and allows them check whether or not they felt the restroom was safe for their bike.

## LEARNING GOALS
- React fundamentals
- Router 
- Asynchronous JavaScript
- E2E testing with Cypress
- Responsive design
- Building an Express API
- Deploying API and application

## FUTURE FEATURES
- GPS maps that works without service letting you know how far you are from a restroom
- adding reviews of the actual toilets/facilities themselves (cleanliness, stocked tp, etc)
- login, crowsourcing reviews, real-time data
